This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict some specific outputs in a dataset.

The StudentLife dataset will be used in this project. This dataset is a collection of sensing data
from the phones of 48 Dartmouth students over 10-week term to assess their mental health,
academic performance and behavioural trends.

The objective of this project is to predict two psychology-related phenomena using the “sensing
data” from mobile a mobile app. The first variable to predict is the flourishing scale, which is
a measure of self-perceived success, and the second is PANAS scores, which is a measure of
positive and negative affect. These two measures are collected through self-reported
questionnaires. The expected predictions can be in the form of regression and/or classification.

The features that will be used in this project are sensing data which has been collected using
automatic sensors. These include physical activity, audio activity, conversation start/end time,
GPS location, Bluetooth data, WiFi, WiFi location, light start/end time, phone lock start/end
time, phone charge start/end time.
